            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Josh Schellenberg and I am a hopeful future IT contributor.
               I am a lifelong learner with a passion for many different things, but the most important
               passion is making a lasting difference in the world. I have always been a bit self-critical
               and have been learning to accept mistakes as lessons to live by and learn from. I started working
               in the Service/Hospitality industry when I was a teenager and eventually managed a restaurant for
               many years. This experience has provided me with many different marketable skills. Customer
               satisfaction, an intuition for other people's feelings, control over many moving pieces at once,
               and the ability to learn quickly and be adaptable to any situation are just some of these skills.
               I am looking to put these skills to use in this educational program I am currently enrolled in.</p>
