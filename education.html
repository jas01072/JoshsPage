            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                My educational experiences have been a bit different than most people. I attended three different high schools because of my father's
                career with the Navy. My freshman year was spent in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. My Sophomore and Junior years both were spent in Toms River, New Jersey.
                My senior year was spent in Tiverton, Rhode Island. I decided after high school to attend Castleton University in Vermont. I completed two semester there
                and then returned to Toms River, NJ to finish my Associates's degree at Ocean County College.

                I was able to graduate Ocean County College with a larger idea of what I wanted to become in my adult life. I received an Associate of Arts Degree in Liberal Arts
                from Ocean County College. I decided to take a few years off from school to work and focus on pressing issues at the time. After becoming more comfortable with my position in life at this point,
                I completed a plan for myself. I enrolled in classes at Columbia College of Missouri, online. This allowed me to attend school part-time as well as work full-time.
                While it did take an exceptional amount of time to complete, I received my Bachelor's Of Science Degree in Management of Information Systems from Columbia College in June of this year. I am currently completing
                an AppAcademy Program for software and web development. I will then begin my career search and am extremely excited to make a difference! With the exponential growth of AI, IT, and all things Tech, I am looking forward
                to contributing and being a part of an amazing point in History.
